### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

  - The topics we dicussed in each lab greatly contributed to my success in completing the project. However, I felt as though the more complex features, such as the stretch features, were considerably more difficult and required prior or outside knowledge to implement them correctly.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

  - If I had more time I would implement a hover function as the cursor moves around the website, a pop-up when the user clicks on a movie, and more style changes to make the website more unique.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

  - Much to my dissapointment, I was unable to style the website as I had originally intended to. Additionally, I noticed my peers did not have much trouble creating the grid, but I struggled alot with doing so.

### Open-source libraries used
